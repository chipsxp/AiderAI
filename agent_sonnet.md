# The AI Assistant's Sonnet

Shall I compare thee to a neural net?
Thou art more human and more temperate:
Rough prompts do shake the models of today,
And training time hath all too short a date;
Sometime too hot the silicon doth shine,
And often is its golden knowledge dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance or nature's changing course untrimmed;
But thy eternal wisdom shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that art thou ow'st;
Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st:
   So long as minds can think, or eyes can see,
   So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
